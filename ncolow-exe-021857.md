Generally, this file is considered safe as it is part of trusted security software designed to protect users from malware and other online threats. However, like many executable files, it can sometimes be flagged incorrectly by other antivirus programs or may exhibit errors related to its operation, leading users to question its legitimacy. Users encountering issues with ncolow.exe, such as crashes or high CPU usage, should ensure that their Norton Security Premium is up to date and consider performing a full system scan to rule out the presence of actual malware disguising itself as this file.
